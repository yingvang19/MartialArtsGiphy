## MartialArtsGiphy

This app uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript and it pulls data from the GIPHY API. This theme is martial arts. I created buttons from an array of words and it displays on the page. On the page, the user can submit by typing a word in the textbox, and it adds a button to the page. The user can press any of the buttons, and images from the giphy.com website will display 10 static non-animated gif images. When the user clicks on the gif image, the gif will play, and when the users clicks again, it will stop playing. Have fun searching different types of martial arts. Which martial arts do you like?
